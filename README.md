# Copy VM File

Contained herein is the code for a powershell script meant to simplify the process of transferring files from a host computer and a virtual machine hosted via Hyper-V. It will enable the services required if they are not enabled and make easy the steps to transfer. I hope it is of aid.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need:
A computer running Windows Pro, Education, or Enterprise.
Administrator Privileges
Hyper-V
A VM that needs files

### Running this file

The steps for running this are pretty simple. Open Powershell as an administrator and run the file within that console.
